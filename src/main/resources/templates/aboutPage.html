<h3>Our Decks</h3>
<div>
    <strong>The Classic- Popsicle</strong>
    <p>
    The popsicle deck is the classic skateboard shape, often seen in street skating and skatepark environments.
    With its symmetrical design, featuring a squared nose and tail, it offers versatility and balance for technical tricks like flips, grinds, and slides.
    The popsicle shape is ideal for skaters who love street skating or want a board that can handle a variety of styles.
    Its compact size makes it perfect for riders looking for quick turns and easy maneuverability.
    </p>
    <strong>The Low Profile- Mini Cruiser</strong>
    <p>
    The mini cruiser deck is a smaller, more compact version of a traditional cruiser, designed for younger riders or those who prefer a lighter, more maneuverable board.
    Its short, wide shape makes it great for casual cruising around town or short commutes.
    Mini cruisers are easy to carry and ideal for navigating crowded areas or tight spaces, making them a favorite choice for those who prioritize portability and fun, relaxed rides.
    </p>
    <strong>The Carver- Pintail</strong>
    <p>
    The pintail deck features a distinctive elongated shape with a wide nose and a tapered tail.
    Known for its stability and smooth ride, the pintail is perfect for cruising and carving on long, smooth stretches of pavement.
    The design prevents wheelbite (where the wheels touch the deck) and offers a fluid, controlled ride, making it a go-to board for long-distance riders or those looking to enjoy leisurely, relaxed rides without the focus on tricks.
    </p>
    <strong>The Styler- Freestyle </strong>
    <p>
    Freestyle decks are designed for skaters who enjoy performing technical tricks with fluidity and style.
    Typically featuring a symmetrical shape and a medium to wide width, these boards are perfect for street and freestyle skateboarding.
    With ample space for foot placement, freestyle decks allow riders to perform a variety of tricks, such as spins, slides, and grinds, while maintaining great control.
    Their versatility and responsiveness make them ideal for skaters who want to combine technical skill with creativity.
    </p>
    <strong>The Traveller- Long Distance Pumping (LDP)</strong>
    <p>
    Long distance pumping decks are designed for riders who want to cover long distances efficiently without pushing.
    These decks are often longer and have a more elongated shape, with a slight concave to enhance foot placement and control.
    The design allows riders to generate speed and momentum through pumping—smooth, rhythmic movements that propel the board forward without the need for constant pushing.
    Perfect for commuters or those seeking a more efficient, smooth ride over long distances, these decks offer an ideal balance of comfort, performance, and style.
